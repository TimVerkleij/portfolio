            One of my biggest side-projects is my own Discord Bot. This is also one of the projects I'm most proud of. Besides making my own Discord Bot, I've also helped other people with making their bot. I have had people reaching out to me with questions regarding
            Discord Bots and I was always ready to help them. So have I collaborated with someone to make sure their bot works and runs 24/7. Both Discord Bots run on Node.JS and are hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.

        <p class="botDescription">
            BucketBot is the name of my own Discord Bot. The name comes from one of my online names. It was originally created for people to have fun with a bot in one of the text channels. After some time I started getting suggestions for things to add to the bot.
            I implemented almost every suggestion I got and I also added some ideas of my own. One of the bigger functionalities that I've added to the bot was the game Tic-Tac-Toe. I wanted some sort of multiplayer game built inside the bot so I challenged
            myself to add that.
            <br> The bot is also used to automate some things inside a specific Discord server. The bot will keep track of certain roles and will grant or revoke roles when needed. Besides that it also checks the member count every day.
            <br><br>
            Overhere you can go to the Bot's GitHub page where you can find the source code:<br>

        <p>
            Jaybot is another Bot I've been working on. This bot was initially created by someone I know from an online community. It started off as a learning project but the head-developer needed some help since it was their first time making a discord bot.
            I mainly helped the other developer to make sure his Bot is up 24/7 without any costs. I also created a GitHub repository for him where he could commit all his changes to. The bot is not being updated very often and this project is very likely to be discarded.<br>
