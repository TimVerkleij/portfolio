            On this website I will summarize my career path. My current goal is to become a Backend software developer with JavaScript as my main language. Most of my projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/TimVerkleij">my GitHub page</a>.

            Throughout the years I've learned multiple languages. I've also worked on projects that used certain frameworks. Below here is a list of all languages and frameworks that I've worked on in the past few years. Most of my projects contain JavaScript, that's
            also why I'm most advanced with this language. It is also the language I most prefer, but I don't mind learning a new language.<br><br>
